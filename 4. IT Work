Interview 1
1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? 

I am a Case Manager for NBN - National Broadband Network going up the ranks from initially starting as a Network Engineer with the company. My daily duties as Case Manager is to take responsibility for each escalations and technical complaints from level 1/2 operators, I lead and among the co-ordination, investigation and proactive follow up of complaints. I also liaise with external regulatory bodies such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, Department of Communications, ACMA and internal authorities.

My further duties would be to prepare concise reports for senior leads on status’ of reports including analysis and of emerging recurring trends and potential impact to the business.
I would also have to develop and drive ongoing strategies for case resolutions including working closely with key managers and stakeholder which facilitate prompt resolutions.

2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.

I work in the Telecommunications Industry although in the IT field. So NBN is NOT a retail service provider like most would see NBN as – a retail service provider is companies such as Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and so forth they are the ones who sell services to endusers/customers. Where as NBN are a wholesaler we provide ’The NBN’ to the retail service providers adding on if you have seen in the media whether it be the news or online, NBN are still laying out there build with a target to have 8 million connected services by 2020. This is why we constantly deal with faults that spread from either individual services like your house or businesses right through to a whole suburb or state.

3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? 

I work with multiple technology types, Fibre to the Premise, Fibre to the Curb, Fibre to the Node, Hybrid Fibre Coaxial, Wireless & Satellite. I would at times need to liaise with field technicians in relations to completed works, complex works and process related queries.

Being a Case Manager you must know the networks in depths from how a service is run to the backbone of it all such as the EAS. EFS, LAGS and even manually configuring changes to a service right through to rebuilding services on our network platforms.

Other factors that are not so technical that I do from time to time is dealing with delivery partners directly - so they are companies such as Service Stream, Downer, BSA and many more. These companies are the ones who are contractors to NBN which are the field technicians and field engineers, we would work closely with them on a constant basis from very minor works such as installations or a lead-in replacement right through remediation works like replacing a power pole to run a new service in the area or replacing a Node which requires diggers, bucket truck, scissor lifts or other heavy machinery/vehicles.

4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. 

I interact with many different type of people/teams whether it be internally or externally. I work closely with Network Engineers and Network Operators who closely monitor outages across Australia, from just being one house or business or to even a state or suburb that has lost service, for example when the flood occurred on QLD or the heavy storms Sydney and Melbourne faced late 2018 during the Christmas period, we would have to work closely and follow up also with field engineers and technicians to get the issue rectified as soon as possible

As I said prior I also liaise with external regulatory bodies such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, Department of Communications, ACMA and internal authorities.

5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. 

My interactions with other IT professionals would be mostly to to pin point what fault or issue is causing there service to have either speed, intermittent dropouts, no sync/data issues.
This is where I would be in contacts with the Network Engineers or Senior Network Engineers to reset LAGs within the backbone of their service - remotely as sometimes we are not able to get a field engineer out on field in an instance.

6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? 

Mostly deal with clients rather than investors as that would not be in my position of power. Although most my interactions with clients are very straight forward which is to update them on what is going on and giving them a time frame on when a service would be up or installed or when works will be completed so the council is able to notify there elected areas, adding on at times I would need to try and explain and have a in depth conversation about what is going on and get very technical which would be a challenge.
 
7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. 

Most things I face on a daily basis would have to be dealing with council issues across Australia, as they have site surveyors that go around the areas putting through reports on health and safety issues.

The issues would mostly be pits or nodes that are damaged or not installed to an Australian regulatory standard, aerial and underground exposed cabling that maybe a safety issue to the public, construction works in new development real estate or new roads being laid out where the diggers would cut through the conduit or fibre whilst digging which leads too an outage in the area.
These would be the main issues I have to focus on constantly as it is deemed as high priority and would need to be followed up and have the matter resolved within a certain time frame depending on how big the problem is.

8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? 

To me what I find most challenging would be relaying the information that I have found from my investigations or field work to different stakeholders due to the fact that you must take into consideration not everyone you speak to has the same technical understanding, so you would need to try and explain things in different ways and have constant meetings to be updated and be sure you are on top of your daily tasks.

The IT field can be overwhelming at times especially in such a demanding area where nowadays everyone “needs the internet” and that no one can survive with it, but if you do enjoy it, you will love it, you meet and network with so many diverse people and the things you learn constantly its intriguing.

9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?

What I can share if on my work laptop, if you would like a screen record or screen cap of what I do here and there I am able to do so and supply them to you. 

What we have learnt from this interview?

From this interview we can gather that this IT’s professionals main duties at work is too take responsibility from escalations which the level 1/2 operators cannot solve, in addition to any follow up complaints, he also responsible for preparing reports and analysing recurring problems and producing active solutions that could impact the business.
He mainly interacts with clients in his field of work, these clients can be either house hold owners, the council or business owners. He also has to work with other IT professionals, such as though level 1/2 operators to help solve and investigate client complaints, while also working with managers and stakeholders to help develop and analysing solutions for recurring issues. He also works with outside servies which help delivery, supply and install NBN.

Most of his time is spent sitting at his desk, as the tools of his trade are there (laptop, phone etc). Although being a Case Manager he is also required to attend weekly meetings.


Interview 2

1.What kind of work is done by the IT professional?

I'm a Junior Software Engineer for Culture Amp. Culture Amp is a web app used to help improve the culture of organisations. My work involves rolling out new features and fixing bugs on the webapp. I code in a number of languages for this, predominately javascript and ruby.

2.What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other ITprofessionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?

I am in a team of 5 people, which includes software engineers, a designer, a quality assurance (tester) and a product manager. my workflow is usually organised by the product manager (PM), who handles all the new features to be created for the app, and sorts them by importance before assigning me one. We have a standup meeting every morning at 9:45am, done via video chat (as the team lead works remotely from adelaide), where we discuss the tasks we're working on for the week, and what we hope to achieve. The product manager does the majority of talking to clients, to determine their needs etc, although I have sat in on meetings with clients before, and the opportunity is always there if we want to. Usually however, I trust what our PM is doing, and spend more of my time coding instead.


3.Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?

We have an open office with no assigned desks, so each morning when I arrive i can choose a desk and plug in my laptop, ready to go. There are also shared/common spaces, including couches and call booths, which i often spend an hour or two in if I really want to focus. I also work from home at least one day a week, to break up the week and see family/look after the dog.
The company is incredibly flexible with this - I feel trusted to do the work, so as a result I set where I want to work from and feel more productive because of this. Most of my day I'm on my computer, using VS code, slack, trello, shell, notion and most importantly, spotify!

4.What aspect of their position is most challenging?

There is a lot of learning in software eng., particularly as a junior. I feel out of my comfort zone a lot, and feel like I'm the dumbest one in the room. I'm slowly learning how to handle and work with this feeling, and how to seek help when I'm stuck. luckily, I'm in a cohort with other juniors who have similar feelings of "Imposter syndrome", so that makes life easier. But overall, learning code patterns, new languages, different parts of the app etc. take a long time to fully understand.
